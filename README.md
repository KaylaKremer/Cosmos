# :sparkles: Cosmos :sparkles:

A small demo app I built using React and THREE.js.

To run, simply use `npm start` in the terminal. You can also make a build with `npm run build`.

You can also view the deployed app here: [https://cosmos.kaylakremer.now.sh/](https://cosmos.kaylakremer.now.sh/)

*Hint: You can interact with the 3D models by clicking on them!*
