# Hello, Viget! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kayla and I'm a front-end developer in the NoVA area. Nice to meet you! ðŸ˜„

I built this small app with React and THREE.js using your logo as inspiration. I've only recently started learning THREE.js on my own, so please forgive the simplicity of it. ðŸ˜…

If you haven't already been able to tell, I love anything 3D! Actually, my bachelors from George Mason University was in videogame design, so I spent a lot of my university days learning how to 3D model with programs like 3ds Max and Unity.

For the past 2.5 years, I've worked as a front-end developer professionally. I'm a self-taught developer, no bootcamp here! Just a determination of wanting to know more than just design, which quickly turned into a passion and then a career.

JavaScript is my preferred language to code in and I love learning new libraries/frameworks for it. Recently, another library I've gotten into is Google's machine learning library for the web called TensorFlow.js, which I also built a small app with. It even got me noticed by O'Reilly Media and I was invited to attend the TensorFlow World conference last month!
