# Viget

A small portfolio app I built using Viget's logo as inspiration. It uses React and THREE.js.

To run, simply use `npm start` in the terminal. You can also make a build with `npm run build`.

You can also view the deployed app here: (https://viget.kaylakremer.now.sh/)[https://viget.kaylakremer.now.sh/]
