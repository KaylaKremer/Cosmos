# :sparkles: Cosmos :sparkles:

A small practice app I made for myself of a planet and its orbiting moons in the cosmos using React & THREE.js.

To run, simply use `npm start` in the terminal. You can also make a build with `npm run build`.

You can also view the deployed app here: [https://cosmos.kaylakremer.now.sh/](https://cosmos.kaylakremer.now.sh/)
